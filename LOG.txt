7:37: Some Current Ideas Are
- Bring Gil Alive! Use Webscraping, and random keywords, to give Gil a 
more dynamic personality.
- Make an algorithm to find tables with certain keys,
- Make the inputs cleaner with tkinker or whatever

-Make an algorithm to create the follow up questions

Taking a lil break kinda fried. As I take a break I'll record here what I exactly I need to 
do next and what problems I have

-Organize user questions and Ai's answers into tables. Ai's answer will be done through the AI Parser. 
The user's questions will be gotten from grabFollowUp. Both returns will be imported to create tables. 

(Prob): Will I have to find that key again? I can copy from the grabFollow sure.
